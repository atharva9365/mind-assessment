          <p className="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
            Samvadiniâ€™s genesis lies in our realization that the resources at
            the centre were under utilized by grassroots groups and people who
            were located far away as they were unable to access it. Distance,
            paucity of resources, and such factors prevent people especially
            women, from utilizing these resources available at the city centre.

            Muskaan an Aalochana Initiative Against Child Sexual Abuse has been
            working on creating awareness about child sexual abuse (CSA) since
            2000. We conduct awareness and training sessions for a diverse
            population of school children, college students, parents, teachers,
            social workers, NGO workers, police personnel, observation home
            children and staff and members of local communities.
